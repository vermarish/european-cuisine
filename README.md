Here's a little dimensionality reduction project I did under the supervision of Dr. Matthew Conroy at the University of Washington.

The conclusions:
* Mediterranean countries know what they like. The ingredients in their kitchens are not very diverse.
* Mediterranean countries like olive oil and garlic.
* The diversity of a European country's kitchen is confounded with how similar it is to that of Mediterranean countries.
* Besides the Mediterranean, the most distinct cultural region in Europe is Scandinavia, at least in terms of food.
* Food in the Netherlands is close enough to food in the U.K.
